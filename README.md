# Problem Statement:
AtliQ Mart is a retail giant that operates over 50 supermarkets in the southern region of India. The company has run a massive promotion during Festive time (i.e. Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024) on their AtilQ brand products. Now we want to understand which promotion performed well and which did not, and this will help in making decisions for the next promotional period.
